    <p>Hello my name is Oz Romero and coding has been one of my greatest passions since I understood what a loop function was. I started coding during my Bachelors program at Occidental College where I was introduced to Matlab to track data collected in a neuron detection experement with a proffesor and since that moment I knew coding had a special place in my heart. After returning to Chicago in 2019, I began to look for ways to submerg myself into the coding culture and gain the invaluable information I sought after, which was learning to develop an app idea from sctrach. </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This is when I discovered the Coding Dojo Chicago 3 month Bootcamp and with the covid pandemic going on I figured what better way to spend");
            WriteLiteral(@" my days inside. Although the three months were intense, I came out knowing more than I thought possible. Being able to develop an app from scratch in not one but three full stacks gave me the confidence to progress in my developer journey which has so many bright possibilities ahead. 
    </p>
    <p>Current Focus: React | C# | Python</p>
    <h3>Previous Work</h3>
        <p>
            Before making the transition into the tech industry, I have been fortunate enough to have gained klnowledge in sales, marketing, branding, and the restaurant industry. While in collge I worked in sales at Nordstrom and consistantly was a top performer in my department. Not only did I improve my sales skills, I also learned the value of customer relations, time managment, and comunication skills. While working at Nordstrom I briefly joined a talent agency (HRI Talent) and did a few comercials that enlightened me on the power of social media.  
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            While with HRI I was al");
            WriteLiteral(@"so working with a startup that focused on Social Media Consulting, which I turned out to have quite an eye for. With a few trainig courses from the CEO I was able to aquire my own clients and help them reach a wider social media audience through algorythems based on Honeypot accounts, image enhancments, and overall more content.(Feel free to <a href=""/contact"">contact me</a> if you would like to arrange a consultation.) With proper marketing techniques I was able to aqure over 20,000 followers on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/iamozromero/"">Instagram</a> and do my own brand deals with Instagram accounts.
